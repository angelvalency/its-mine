        <br>
        I'm usually called angel, but my friends always give the name 'njel' to every contact name, it's funny hehehe.
        <br>
        oh! I am a loyal viewer of the Harry Potter series and a fan of Olivia Rodrigoand because of that hobby,
        listening to music angitd watching films have become my corny hobbies. SO, WELCOME TO MY DESK !!
